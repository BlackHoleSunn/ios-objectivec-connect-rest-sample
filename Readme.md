# Office 365 Connect Sample for iOS Using Unified API (Preview)

Connecting to Office 365 is the first step every iOS app must take to start working with Office 365 services and data. This sample shows how to connect and then call one API through the Unified API.

 
## Prerequisites
* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/) from Apple
* Installation of [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html)  as a dependency manager.
* An Office 365 account. You can sign up for [an Office 365 Developer subscription](https://portal.office.com/Signup/Signup.aspx?OfferId=6881A1CB-F4EB-4db3-9F18-388898DAF510&DL=DEVELOPERPACK&ali=1#0) that includes the resources that you need to start building Office 365 apps.

     > Note: If you already have a subscription, the previous link sends you to a page with the message *Sorry, you canâ€™t add that to your current account*. In that case use an account from your current Office 365 subscription.
* A Microsoft Azure tenant to register your application. Azure Active Directory provides identity services that applications use for authentication and authorization. A trial subscription can be acquired here: [Microsoft Azure](https://account.windowsazure.com/SignUp).

     > Important: You will also need to ensure your Azure subscription is bound to your Office 365 tenant. To do this see the Active Directory team's blog post, [Creating and Managing Multiple Windows Azure Active Directories](http://blogs.technet.com/b/ad/archive/2013/11/08/creating-and-managing-multiple-windows-azure-active-directories.aspx). The section **Adding a new directory** will explain how to do this. You can also see [Set up your Office 365 development environment](https://msdn.microsoft.com/office/office365/howto/setup-development-environment#bk_CreateAzureSubscription) and the section **Associate your Office 365 account with Azure AD to create and manage apps** for more information.
      
* A client id and redirect uri values of an application registered in Azure. This sample application must be granted the **Send mail as signed-in user** permission for the **Office 365 unified API (preview)**. [Add a native client application in Azure](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn132599.aspx#BKMK_Adding) and [grant proper permissions](https://github.com/OfficeDev/O365-iOS-Unified-API-Connect/wiki/Grant-permissions-to-the-Connect-application-in-Azure) to it.


       
## Opening the sample using XCode

1. Clone this repository
2. Use CocoaPods to import the Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) iOS dependency:
        
	     pod 'ADALiOS', '~> 1.2.4'

 This sample app already contains a podfile that will get the ADAL components(pods) into  the project. Simply navigate to the project From **Terminal** and run 
        
        pod install
        
   For more information, see **Using CocoaPods** in [Additional Resources](#AdditionalResources)
  
3. Open **O365-iOS-Unified-API-Connect.xcworkspace**
4. Open **ConnectViewController.m**. You'll see that the **ClientID** and **RedirectUri** values can be added to the top of the file. Supply the necessary values here:

        // You will set your application's clientId and redirect URI. 
        NSString * const kRedirectUri = @"ENTER_REDIRECT_URI_HERE";
        NSString * const kClientId    = @"ENTER_CLIENT_ID_HERE";
        NSString * const kAuthority   = @"https://login.microsoftonline.com/common";
    
    > Note: If you have don't have CLIENT_ID and REDIRECT_URI values, [add a native client application in Azure](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn132599.aspx#BKMK_Adding) and take note of the CLIENT\_ID and REDIRECT_URI.

Run the sample once above steps are complete.
